# Flexible Pipeline Information Extraction

Machine learning-based information extraction meant based on a flexible pipeline. Intended to be used withcorpora annotated using the Brat rapit annotation tool. Uses scipy-learn.

Can only perform NER at the moment, and the interface to specify the extraction task is not user-friendly. This will hopefully improve in the coming weeks.

## Version history:

0.0.1: Somewhat functioning NER extraction system

## Short term TODOs:

* Improve interface (define a format for specifying how the job looks, read specification and act accordingly).
* Improve memory usage so that the full GENIA training set can be used.
* Add additional features.
